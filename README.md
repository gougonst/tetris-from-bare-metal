# tetris-from-bare-metal

This project is designed for learning Computer Systems. The goal is to build a playable Tetris game on bare metal using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and its peripherals. The process will be divided into several phases: first, constructing the Tetris game using the built-in SDK, then progressively replacing SDK modules with custom-written ones, ultimately aiming for a build that's as close to Bare Metal as possible.
